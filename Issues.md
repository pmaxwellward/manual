# Bugs and Features

VCV offers technical support of commercial VCV plugins by emailing <support@vcvrack.com>.

For technical support of VCV Rack, open-source VCV plugins, and third-party plugins, refer to the correct category below.

## Bug reports for Rack

If you encounter a bug in VCV Rack itself (not a plugin), such as a UI issue, broken functionality, hang, or crash, follow these steps.

- Log in or register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Search [Rack's issue tracker](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to check if someone else has posted a similar bug report.
	- If the bug is already reported, vote for it by adding a "thumb-up" reaction on the first post.
	- If not, [open a bug report issue](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and fill out the issue template.
	If the template is not filled out, your issue will be closed.

A developer then attempts to reproduce and identify your bug.
If successful, a fix is implemented, publicly tested with development builds, and released in a future Rack version.

## Feature requests for Rack

If you want to propose a feature or change for VCV Rack (not a plugin), follow these steps.

- Log in or register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Search [Rack's issue tracker](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to check if someone else has posted a similar feature request.
	- If the feature is already requested, vote for it by adding a "thumb-up" reaction on the first post.

Your proposal is then discussed and possibly modified.
If approved, the feature is implemented, publicly tested with development builds, and released in a future Rack version.

## Bug reports and feature requests for Rack plugins

If a bug or feature request involves a particular plugin for Rack rather than Rack itself, follow these steps.

- Search for the plugin on the [VCV Library](https://library.vcvrack.com/).
- If the plugin's source code or website is hosted on GitHub or GitLab, open an issue in the Issues tab. Accounts on these websites are free.
- If not, use the provided contact information by clicking on the email icon or author's website.
- For bug reports, include the plugin's version, your operating system and version, and steps to reproduce the bug.
